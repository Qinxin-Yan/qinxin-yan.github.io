### Research Overview

My research lies at the intersection of **mean field control**, **mean field games**, **partial differential equations**, and **financial mathematics**. I am particularly interested in both the theoretical and numerical aspects of stochastic systems arising in large population dynamics, financial networks, and learning models.

I work extensively with:
- Viscosity solutions of partial differential equations in the Wasserstein space
- Neural network-based solvers for high-dimensional control problems
- Interacting particle systems and graph-based models
- Applications of mean field theory in systemic risk and machine learning

### 1. Machine Learning and Mean Field Optimal Control

We study numerical methods for solving mean field optimal control problems by leveraging machine learning techniques. A convergence proof based on propogation of chaos and Rademacher complexity is provided. We also discuss universal approximation theorem of the neural networks on Wasserstein spaces.

### 3. Large Interacting Particle Systems on Sparse Graphs

We investigate particle systems with singular local interactions through hitting times on sparse graphs, motivated by problems in systemic risk and network fragility.
