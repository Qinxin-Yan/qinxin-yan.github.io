I am **Qinxin Yan**, a fifth-year PhD student in the [Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM)](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. H. Mete Soner](https://soner.princeton.edu/) in the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE).

My research develops asymptotic mathematical frameworks for **large stochastic and strategic systems**, combining control theory, game theory, and learning to analyze and design decision mechanisms in multi-agent and networked environments. I blend stochastic analysis, mean-field limits, and graph-theoretic modeling with machine-learning–based algorithms to connect rigorous theory with applications in real-world problems, such as finance and machine learning.

Previously, I was a visiting scholar with the [Insurance Mathematics and Stochastic Finance Group (Group 3)](https://math.ethz.ch/imsf) in the Department of Mathematics at ETH Zurich. There, I worked with [Prof. Josef Teichmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jteichma/) on numerical methods for mean field games, and with [Prof. Beatrice Acciaio](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~beacciaio/) on the mean field formulation of large neural networks.

My current projects include:
- Viscosity solutions of Hamilton–Jacobi equations arising in mean field control
- Numerical methods for mean field optimal control problems and mean field games
- Large interacting particle systems with singular interactions on sparse graphs
- Applications of mean field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows in large-scale neural networks

I am on the job market for fall 2025.
