I am **Qinxin Yan**, a fourth-year PhD student in the [Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM)](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. H. Mete Soner](https://orfe.princeton.edu/people/h-soner) in the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE).

My research lies at the intersection of **mean field control**, **mean field games**, **partial differential equations**, and **financial mathematics**, with a focus on both theoretical foundations and machine learning-based numerical algorithms.

Previously, I was a visiting scholar with the [Insurance Mathematics and Stochastic Finance Group (Group 3)](https://math.ethz.ch/research/insurance-mathematics-and-stochastic-finance.html) in the Department of Mathematics at ETH Zurich. There, I worked with [Prof. Josef Teichmann](https://math.ethz.ch/the-department/people.html?u=jteichma) on numerical methods for mean field games, and with [Prof. Beatrice Acciaio](https://math.ethz.ch/the-department/people.html?u=beatrice) on the mean field formulation of large neural networks.

My current projects include:
- Viscosity solutions of Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi equations arising in mean field control
- Numerical methods for mean field optimal control problems and mean field games
- Large interacting particle systems with singular interactions on sparse graphs
- Applications of mean field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows in large-scale neural networks
