### Research Overview

My research lies at the intersection of **mean field control**, **mean field games**, **partial differential equations**, and **financial mathematics**. I am particularly interested in both the theoretical and numerical aspects of stochastic systems arising in large population dynamics, financial networks, and learning models.

I work with:
- Viscosity solutions of partial differential equations in the Wasserstein space
- Interacting particle systems and graph-based models
- Applications of mean field theory in systemic risk and machine learning
- Numerical methods for high-dimensional control problems and games

### 1. Viscosity Solutions in Wasserstein Space

We prove comparison principles of the viscosity solutions of Hamilton–Jacobi equations  on the Wasserstein spaces.

### 2. Large Interacting Particle Systems on Sparse Graphs

We investigate particle systems with singular local interactions through hitting times on sparse graphs, motivated by problems in systemic risk in financial networks.

### 3. Numerical Methods for Mean Field Optimal Control and N-particle Games

We study numerical methods for solving mean field optimal control problems by leveraging machine learning techniques. A convergence proof based on propogation of chaos and Rademacher complexity is provided. We also discuss universal approximation theorem of the neural networks on Wasserstein spaces.

We study Markov perfect equilibria in continuous-time dynamic games with finitely many symmetric players. We prove the convergence of both Picard and weighted Picard iterations, yielding efficient computational methods. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of algorithms based on this approach.
